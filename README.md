# Python-Driven UI for Advanced SQL Database Operations

This project is about building a powerful web-based application using **Python (Streamlit)** that lets users interact with a **MySQL database**—without needing to write any SQL code.

In the real world, many people (like managers or team leads) need to work with data stored in databases, but they don’t know SQL.  
This app helps those users do important tasks like:

- Viewing data  
- Running operations (like updating stock)  
- Checking reports or summaries  

All of this can be done with a simple, easy-to-use interface.

## 🚀 How the Project Works (2 Main Steps)

### **Step 1: Build the MySQL Database**
We’ll design a smart database that includes:

- **Tables:** For things like products, orders, shipments, and inventory  
- **Views:** For reports and summaries (e.g., product history)  
- **Stored Procedures:** For actions like receiving an order or updating stock  
- **Functions:** For business calculations (e.g., check if a product needs restocking)  

This step simulates how businesses store and organize data with rules built into the database.

### **Step 2: Build the Streamlit Frontend**
Next, we’ll create a web interface using **Streamlit** that allows users to:

- View and filter data from tables and views  
- Use buttons to run stored procedures (e.g., “Mark order as received”)  
- Add or update records (like new products or prices) using clicks  
- Run calculations using SQL functions  
- See live results on screen—without writing SQL

## 💡 What Makes This Project Advanced?

- Combines **SQL (backend)** with **Python (frontend)**  
- Uses real database tools like **views**, **stored procedures**, and **functions**  
- Demonstrates how to build systems used in inventory, sales, and operations  
- Helps you understand how real-world apps are built with multiple layers  
- Teaches you how to create tools that non-technical users can actually use
